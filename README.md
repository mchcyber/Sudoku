Sudoku is a popular logic-based puzzle game that involves filling a 9x9 grid with numbers so that each column, each row, and each of the nine 3x3 subgrids (called "regions" or "boxes") contains all of the digits from 1 to 9. The puzzle starts with some cells already filled with numbers, and the player's task is to fill in the remaining cells following the rules. The puzzle is solved when all cells are filled correctly according to the rules. Sudoku puzzles come in varying levels of difficulty, and they are often found in newspapers, puzzle books, and as mobile or online games.
